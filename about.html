      <div class="our-history">
        <h4>Our History</h4>
        <p>Diztinct, Inc. was started back in 2004. In the early years, we specialized in custom eBay Store designs and designing ecommerce websites on the ChannelAdvisor platform. In 2006, Diztinct’s custom eBay Store for Grapevinehill won eBay’s prestigious Best Looking Store award.<br><br>As Diztinct grew, we began to branch out into other ecommerce platforms. In 2012, we decided to narrow our platforms down in order to be better experts at a select few. Today, we offer design and development services on the top 3 shopping cart platforms on the market: Bigcommerce, Shopify and Magento. We also offer custom design on the top 2 marketplaces: Amazon and eBay. <br><br>Our extensive knowledge allows us to provide our clients with the very best designs, features and performance on each of these systems.</p>
